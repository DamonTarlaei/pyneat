* configuration for dumping overall champion to a file everytime a new champion is discovered
* should not consider invalid networks?
   - networks with no connections to output
* cull hidden nodes with no out synapses?
   - output signal will never propagate to the output layer
* gui
   - recurrant connection drawing
   - text weight on connection lines
   - open existing network file for display
   - open/load start genes
   - should be able to monitor/control parallel jobs (Linda) through interface
* use python logging module for console output?
   - possibly get rid of 'if debug' stuff
* features
   - hyperneat
   - Q learning
   - temporal delay, signal delay
      - leaky [integrator] neurons
      - Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Networks (CTRNNs)
* more examples
* testing
* optimize
